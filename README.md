## Technologies:


This project requires **[Python 3.x](https://www.python.org)** and the following Python libraries installed:


- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org)



You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an 
[iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)


## Data

The data for this project are three audio files where each one of them contain a mixed recording of the three different audio components. And each one of the recording are recorded from different angle. As, you can see in the image below.
